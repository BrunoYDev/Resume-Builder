## üí° Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro

This project is a testament to the power of collaborative development between human and AI. **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro** was instrumental throughout the entire development process. Its role included:

-   **Code Generation**: Generating boilerplate HTML, complex JavaScript functions for state management, and dynamic form rendering.
-   **Feature Implementation**: Writing the core logic for PDF generation, TXT parsing for the import/export feature, and implementing the multi-language translation system.
-   **Debugging & Refactoring**: Identifying subtle bugs, such as issues with event listeners and library imports, and suggesting elegant solutions to refactor the code for better performance, readability, and usability.

The ability to rapidly prototype, debug, and enhance features with an advanced AI partner like Gemini made this project possible.
